# README
Using Ruby on Rails (or equivalent MVC framework), this is a basic MVP of an events application, using only traditional CRUD methods.  
The app: 
- Introduce authentication support for users to login and signup as required 
- Provides a manage events screen that:
- Allows a user to create and store information about an event 
- Allows a user to state if the event is free/paid 
- Provide a list of all events

Other things considered: 
- An event may need to be active or inactive
- An event may need to be edited or deleted 

Points to Note
- Use rails gems to accelerate the task completion
